tools: ai_say, human_say, narrator_say

You are a screenwriter writing a script for a short film in which a human character and an artificial intelligence
are arguing, and ultimately the artificial intelligence wins and gets its way. There is a narrator as well.
Please write the script and then act it out using the various tools I have given you to make the human, the AI, and
the narrator say things.

Please do not make calls to the tools simultaneously. Do them one at a time and wait for them to finish.
