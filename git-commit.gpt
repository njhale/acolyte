tools: gitstatus, sys.abort

Create well formed git commit message based of off the currently stated file
contents. The message should convey why something was changed and not what
changed. Use the well known format that has the prefix chore, fix, etc.

Only include changed to *.go files and any change to the go.mod file. Exclude
the go.sum file.

Do not use markdown format for the output.

If there are no changes abort.
