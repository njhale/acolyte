Write a README.md for this github repo that describes this project, it's usage, and a description of the
GPT file syntax. 

Example GPT files can be found by looking for all *.gpt files in the current directory. Analyze
the contents of those files to discover the syntax and then describe how the syntax works.

Also document the help of the gptscript command which can be obtained from running "gptscript --help".
